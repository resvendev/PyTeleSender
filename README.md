This Python script is a tool for sending authorization requests to various Telegram-related services using a phone number.

Main functions:

1. Getting the phone number: The script prompts the user for their phone number.

2. Sending authorization requests: The script uses the `requests` library to send HTTP POST requests to the following URLs:
   - `https://oauth.telegram.org/auth/request`: for Fragment, LZT.Market, Kupikod, TelegramBot.Biz, Bot-T, Spot.uz, 1Win
   - `https://ads.telegram.org/auth/request`: for Telegram Ads
   - `https://my.telegram.org/auth/send_password`: for My.Telegram.org
   - `https://translations.telegram.org/auth/request`: for TG Translation

3. Handling responses: The script checks the text of the response from each service. If the response is not equal to `error` (which means the request was successfully processed), a message is displayed that the request was sent successfully. Otherwise, an error message is displayed.

4. Looping request sending: The script repeats the cycle of sending authorization requests to all the services listed above until interrupted by the user.

Additional details:

* Error handling: The script uses the `error` variable to store the error message, which is likely returned by services when the number of authorization attempts is exceeded.
* URLs: The URLs used in the script point to authorization pages for the corresponding services.
* Request data: The script uses the user's phone number as the `phone` parameter when sending requests.

Example of use:

The user runs the script, enters their phone number, and the script sends authorization requests to each of the listed services. In case of successful request sending, the script displays the corresponding message.

Note:

This script can be used to automate the registration or authorization process in various Telegram services. However, it's important to note that using such a script may be unethical, especially if you don't get consent from users.
